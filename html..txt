			  <P class="introduce">My name is Fasial Elias Mandoo. I'm from Iraq.Similar to you, I was a student who fid up with the methods of memorization, which most of Middle-East countries are pursuing. I wanted to try some new educational approaches. Approaches that emphasize on comprehension and individualism. After many attempts, I got an opportunity to study at a university call LCC International University. This university is so amazing that I desire to get other people to know about.</p>
